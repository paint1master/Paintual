# Paintual
A drawing application; it's main goal (wish) is that it could draw all by itself.

Essentially, Paintual is an experiment devised to create interesting visual elements. It is not meant to become a copy/clone or variant of any current drawing software. It's code and, of course the errors it may contain, is used as a sort of feedback process.

Eventually Paintual should be able to take images from a personal catalog and assemble them according to user defined rules and styles.

## Installation

As of now (2018-01-07) the project does not offer an installable. Anyone interested in the project needs to download the files and compile/execute them in Visual Studio 2017 (Commnity Edition is free: <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/>
